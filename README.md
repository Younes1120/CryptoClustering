# Crypto Clustering

## Overview

The Crypto Clustering project aims to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering. Additionally, the project explores the impact of dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on clustering.

## Steps

1. Load and preprocess the data: The first step is to load the cryptocurrency data and perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values or encoding categorical variables.

2. Scale the data using StandardScaler: To ensure that all features have equal importance during clustering, it is important to scale the data. The StandardScaler is used to normalize the features.

3. Find the best value for k using the elbow method: The elbow method helps in determining the optimal number of clusters for the K-means algorithm. It involves calculating the within-cluster sum of squares for different values of k and selecting the value where the change in the sum of squares starts to level off.

4. Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original scaled data: Once the optimal value of k is determined, the K-means algorithm is applied to cluster the cryptocurrencies based on their features.

5. Perform PCA to reduce the features to three principal components: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original features into a new set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. In this step, PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data to three principal components.

6. Find the best value for k using the PCA data: Similar to step 3, the optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method, but this time on the reduced-dimensional PCA data.

7. Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA data: With the optimal value of k obtained from step 6, the K-means algorithm is applied to cluster the cryptocurrencies based on the reduced-dimensional PCA data.

8. Visualize and compare the results using hvPlot: Finally, the results are visualized using interactive plots generated by hvPlot, allowing for a clear comparison between the clusters obtained from the original data and the PCA data.

## Results

The project includes the following visualizations:

1. Elbow curve for the original data: This plot shows the change in the within-cluster sum of squares for different values of k using the original scaled data. The optimal value of k is determined by identifying the "elbow" point where the change in sum of squares starts to level off.

2. Elbow curve for the PCA data: Similar to the previous plot, this visualization displays the change in the within-cluster sum of squares for different values of k using the reduced-dimensional PCA data. The optimal value of k is determined based on the "elbow" point.

3. Scatter plot of cryptocurrency clusters based on the original data: This plot illustrates the clustering results obtained using the original scaled data. Each point represents a cryptocurrency, and the color indicates the assigned cluster.

4. Scatter plot of cryptocurrency clusters based on the PCA data: This plot showcases the clustering results obtained using the reduced-dimensional PCA data. Each point represents a cryptocurrency, and the color indicates the assigned cluster.

## Conclusion

The Crypto Clustering project explores the application of unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering, to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by price changes. By comparing the clustering results obtained from the original scaled data and the reduced-dimensional PCA data, the project demonstrates the impact of dimensionality reduction on the clustering process. These visualizations and insights help in understanding the relationships and patterns within the cryptocurrency market.
